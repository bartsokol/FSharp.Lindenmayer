# FSharp.Lindenmayer

[L-system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-system) representation written in F#.

The goal is to create library / tool which you can use to play with L-systems. Currently implementation allows to model and export system in given generation to SVG (in HTML file) using Turtle graphics drawing mechanism.

The plan is to separate the drawing library as another project and then leave this project as a L-system modeling library.

Based on implementation posted by [Mathias Brandewinder](https://github.com/mathias-brandewinder) on [his blog](http://brandewinder.com/2015/01/11/fun-with-L-System/).
